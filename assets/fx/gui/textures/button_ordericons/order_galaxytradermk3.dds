# GalaxyTrader MK3 Order Icon Placeholder
# This should be replaced with a proper DDS texture file
# For now this prevents the "Could not find order icon" error
# 
# To create a proper icon:
# 1. Create a 64x64 pixel image in your preferred graphics editor
# 2. Save as DDS format with DXT5 compression
# 3. Replace this file with the actual DDS file
#
# The icon should represent trading/commerce activities
