    <t id="3204">Commander,\n\nI've detected cargo in my hold during my systems check. Before I can begin normal trading operations, I need to sell this merchandise.\n\nI'm using our trade search to find the best buyer and safely offload this cargo. Once my hold is clear, I'll proceed with automated trading.\n\nStatus: Searching for optimal sale location\n\nWith diligence,\nAboard %1</t>
    <t id="3205">Commander,\n\nMy hull integrity has dropped to %1%% (threshold: %2%%). As a Level %3 pilot, I'm authorized to request auto-repair services.\n\nI'm proceeding to %4 for repair work. The estimated cost is %5 Cr, which is within our budget.\n\nOnce repairs are complete, I'll resume trading operations with full structural integrity.\n\nRespectfully,\nAboard %6</t>
    <t id="3206">Commander,\n\nURGENT FINANCIAL WARNING\n\nMy hull integrity is critical at %1%% (threshold: %2%%), but our available funds (%3 Cr) are insufficient for full repairs (estimated cost: %4 Cr).\n\nI'm proceeding to %5 for PARTIAL REPAIRS using our available funds. This isn't an ideal solution, but it's necessary to maintain operational capability.\n\nPlease consider allocating additional funds for future maintenance operations.\n\nConcerned but determined,\nAboard %6</t>
