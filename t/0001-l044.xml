    <t id="9480">Maximum waiters woken per scheduler tick (1-10). Limits wake rate to prevent CPU spikes when many waiters are queued. Lower values reduce CPU spikes but slow down waiter processing. Higher values process faster but may cause stutter. Default: 2.</t>
    <t id="9481">Maximum cache entries queried per batch (1-100). Controls cache query batch size. Lower values make cache searches faster but may miss better trades. Higher values consider more cached trades but increase validation time. Default: 5.</t>
    <t id="9482">Live search state stale threshold in seconds (60-600). When live search state is older than this, it's considered stale and cleared. Lower values clear stale state sooner but may interrupt legitimate searches. Higher values allow longer searches but may leave stale state. Default: 300s.</t>
    <t id="9483">Queue item stale threshold in seconds (30-300). When queue items are older than this, they're considered stale and removed. Lower values clear stale items sooner but may remove legitimate queued items. Higher values allow longer queue times but may leave stale items. Default: 60s.</t>
    <t id="9484">Failed trade cache expiration in seconds (300-3600). Failed trades are cached to avoid retrying immediately. Lower values expire failed trades sooner (more retries) but reduce cache effectiveness. Higher values cache longer (fewer retries) but may delay retry attempts. Default: 1800s (30 minutes).</t>
    <t id="9485">Maximum concurrent fallback live searches (1-10). Fallback searches bypass home-sector lock, allowing multiple ships from the same home sector to search simultaneously. Lower values reduce CPU load but may slow down fallback searches. Higher values allow more parallel fallback searches but increase CPU usage. Default: 1.</t>
