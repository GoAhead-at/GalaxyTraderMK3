## Version 0.2.1 - Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
**Release Date**: 2025-10-18

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Ship Naming System
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Ship names no longer reset during order suspensions (police scans, interruptions)
  - **Root Cause**: Police scans and order interruptions trigger the `<on_abort>` handler which was restoring ship names to base form
  - **Impact**: Ships in high-traffic areas lost their rank/level/XP indicators multiple times per session
  - **Solution**: Order pause operations now preserve the current ship name instead of restoring original
  - Ships keep their progression indicators (e.g., "Merkur Verteidiger (Lehrling Lv.2 XP:229)") through all order suspensions
  - Name restoration to original only occurs on permanent order removal, not temporary suspensions
  - Fixed in `HandleShipOrderPaused` cue (lines 522-529 in `gt_core_system.xml`)
- **Fixed**: Undefined `$pilotData` variable causing ship renaming failures for paused/resumed ships
  - Ships like KPW-164, DIQ-431 were not properly renamed with rank/level/XP after order pause/resume
  - Fixed in three locations: fallback registration (line 373), pilot change monitor (lines 707-727), and unregistered pilot handling (lines 820-821)
- **Added**: One-time legacy ship name fix that automatically updates improperly named ships on game load
  - Only processes ships with names exactly matching their original base names
  - Prevents unnecessary updates to already-properly-named ships
  - Runs once per save game, then marks itself complete

#### Core System Stability
- **Fixed**: Property lookup failure for `$pauseData.$OriginalName` in `HandleShipOrderPaused` cue
  - Added safe property access with `?` operator to prevent crashes during order pause operations
  - Line 526 in `gt_core_system.xml`

#### Territory Management
- **Fixed**: Null sector being used as table key causing cascade errors
  - Added null validation before using sector as table key in conflict resolution
  - Ships with unassigned/null territories now safely skipped during conflict checks
  - Lines 491-501 in `gt_territory_management.xml`

#### Trade System
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Trade caching system had reversed BuyOffer/SellOffer assignments
  - **Root Cause**: When caching trades, BuyOffer was assigned `$sellOffer` and SellOffer was assigned `$buyOffer` (backwards!)
  - **Impact**: Cached trades were unusable, causing 100% cache misses and forcing all ships to use expensive live searches
  - **Performance Impact**: Level 12+ ships performed full market scans every time instead of using cached routes
  - **Solution**: Corrected assignments to `$BuyOffer = $buyOffer` and `$SellOffer = $sellOffer`
  - Added debug logging for cache population to track cache effectiveness
  - Fixed in lines 672-690 in `gt_trading_search.xml`
- **Fixed**: Invalid trade offer property access causing errors during logging
  - Trade offers can become invalid between order creation and logging due to:
    - Trade completion/consumption
    - Offer expiration
    - Station destruction/unavailability
  - Added validation checks for both buy and sell offers before accessing properties
  - Gracefully handles invalid offers with "[INVALID/EXPIRED]" messages
  - Fixed in both `gt_trade_logging.xml` (line 40) and `gt_trading_execution.xml` (line 149)

#### Market Intelligence
- **Fixed**: Invalid sector error during ship jumps/transitions
  - Mobile Satellite Intelligence now validates sector exists before scanning
  - Ships in jump transitions are safely skipped with debug logging
  - Line 90 in `gt_market_intelligence.xml`

### üìä Fleet Report Optimization

- **Optimized**: Fleet report for large fleets (100+ ships)
  - **Problem**: Reports with 100 ships generated 600-800 lines causing X4 widget overflow (2288px required vs 1882px available)
  - **Solution**: Limited individual ship details to top 15 performers by profit
  - Ships are automatically sorted by profitability
  - Fleet totals still calculated for all ships
  - Added "... and X more ships not shown" footer for transparency
  - Lines 83-176 in `gt_reporting.xml`

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Improved**: Error handling for timing-sensitive operations
  - All trade offer access now includes existence validation
  - Sector validation added before spatial queries
  - Property lookups use safe `?` operator consistently
  
- **Enhanced**: Debug logging for troubleshooting
  - Added context messages for skipped operations (invalid sectors, invalid offers)
  - Legacy ship name fix shows detailed progress and results
  - Better visibility into error recovery paths

### üìù Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `gt_core_system.xml` - Ship naming fixes, legacy name fix system, pause/resume handling
- `gt_territory_management.xml` - Null sector validation
- `gt_trading_search.xml` - **Trade cache critical fix (reversed BuyOffer/SellOffer)**
- `gt_trade_logging.xml` - Invalid trade offer handling
- `gt_trading_execution.xml` - Invalid trade offer handling  
- `gt_market_intelligence.xml` - Invalid sector handling during jumps
- `gt_reporting.xml` - Fleet report optimization for large fleets

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Trade caching now functional** - Level 12+ ships can use cached routes for faster searches
- ‚úÖ **Significant performance improvement** for high-level fleets (no more redundant full market scans)
- ‚úÖ Eliminates all property lookup errors
- ‚úÖ Handles large fleets (100+ ships) without UI errors
- ‚úÖ Gracefully handles timing issues between trade execution and logging
- ‚úÖ Ships in transition states (jumping) no longer cause errors
- ‚úÖ All ships properly renamed with rank/level/XP indicators
- ‚úÖ Improved stability during order pause/resume cycles

### üéØ User-Facing Improvements

- **Ships maintain their rank/level/XP names through police scans and order interruptions**
  - Previously, every police scan would reset ship names to base form
  - This was especially problematic in high-traffic sectors (Argon Prime, trading hubs, etc.)
  - Ships now keep their progression indicators permanently
- **Trade caching now works properly for Level 12+ pilots**
  - High-level pilots can now reuse profitable routes discovered by other ships
  - Significantly faster trade searches for experienced traders
  - Reduced CPU load from redundant market scanning
- Ships that were missing rank/level/XP in names are automatically fixed on game load
- Fleet reports now display cleanly even with 100+ active ships
- No more error messages during normal trading operations
- Better handling of edge cases (ship jumping, orders being replaced, etc.)

### üö® Why This Update Is Important

**1. Police Scan Issue (Ship Names)**
The police scan issue was causing ships to lose their names constantly during normal gameplay:
- Every time a police ship scanned your traders ‚Üí name reset to base form
- In busy sectors, this could happen multiple times per hour
- Players couldn't reliably track pilot progression due to constant name resets
- **This fix ensures your pilot progression is always visible**, regardless of police activity

**2. Trade Caching System (Performance)**
The trade cache had reversed BuyOffer/SellOffer assignments, making it completely non-functional:
- Level 12+ ships were supposed to benefit from cached trade routes
- Instead, **100% cache misses** forced every ship to perform full market scans
- With 100+ ships, this caused significant performance overhead
- **This fix enables the cache**, dramatically improving search performance for high-level pilots
