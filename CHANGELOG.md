## Version 0.2.1 - Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
**Release Date**: 2025-10-18

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Ship Naming System
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Ship names no longer reset during order suspensions (police scans, interruptions)
  - **Root Cause**: Police scans and order interruptions trigger the `<on_abort>` handler which was restoring ship names to base form
  - **Impact**: Ships in high-traffic areas lost their rank/level/XP indicators multiple times per session
  - **Solution**: Order pause operations now preserve the current ship name instead of restoring original
  - Ships keep their progression indicators (e.g., "Merkur Verteidiger (Lehrling Lv.2 XP:229)") through all order suspensions
  - Name restoration to original only occurs on permanent order removal, not temporary suspensions
  - Fixed in `HandleShipOrderPaused` cue (lines 522-529 in `gt_core_system.xml`)
- **Fixed**: Undefined `$pilotData` variable causing ship renaming failures for paused/resumed ships
  - Ships like KPW-164, DIQ-431 were not properly renamed with rank/level/XP after order pause/resume
  - Fixed in three locations: fallback registration (line 373), pilot change monitor (lines 707-727), and unregistered pilot handling (lines 820-821)
- **Added**: One-time legacy ship name fix that automatically updates improperly named ships on game load
  - Only processes ships with names exactly matching their original base names
  - Prevents unnecessary updates to already-properly-named ships
  - Runs once per save game, then marks itself complete

#### Core System Stability
- **Fixed**: Property lookup failure for `$pauseData.$OriginalName` in `HandleShipOrderPaused` cue
  - Added safe property access with `?` operator to prevent crashes during order pause operations
  - Line 526 in `gt_core_system.xml`

#### Territory Management
- **Fixed**: Null sector being used as table key causing cascade errors
  - Added null validation before using sector as table key in conflict resolution
  - Ships with unassigned/null territories now safely skipped during conflict checks
  - Lines 491-501 in `gt_territory_management.xml`

#### Trade System
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Trade cache system REFACTORED - switched from nested tables to flat list structure
  - **Root Cause**: X4 MD system has fundamental, unfixable issues with nested dynamic tables using string keys
    - X4 locks empty `table[]` immediately upon creation, refusing ALL subsequent key additions (even in same cue!)
    - Key type must be determined at table creation, cannot be changed after
    - Table literal syntax only accepts property keys (`$prop`), not regular identifiers or underscores
    - X4 locks tables across execution contexts permanently
    - No workaround exists - tried 7+ different approaches, all failed
  - **Failed Attempts** (documented in `CACHE_SYSTEM_DEBUGGING.md`):
    1. Auto-creation of nested paths - X4 doesn't support this
    2. String keys everywhere - still locked immediately
    3. Extracting keys to variables - still locked
    4. Lazy initialization on first write - still locked
    5. Property key sentinel `$init` - locks entire table to property-keys-only
    6. Two-step init `table[]` then `.{'init'}` - still locked
    7. Same execution context creation - STILL LOCKED!
  - **Impact**: Level 12+ ships couldn't cache trades, performing expensive full market scans constantly
  - **FINAL SOLUTION**: **Abandoned nested tables entirely - switched to flat list structure**
    - Cache is now `global.$GT_TradeCache = []` (list, not nested tables)
    - Each entry is a flat table containing all trade data
    - Write: Simple `append_to_list` with complete trade entry
    - Read: O(n) iteration with TTL/distance/ROI filters (50-500 entries = microseconds)
    - Maintenance: Rebuild list without expired entries
    - No table key issues whatsoever - lists work reliably in X4
  - **MIGRATION v4**: Automatically converts old nested table structure to list on game load
  - Fixed in: `gt_global_settings.xml` line 161, `gt_trading_search.xml` lines 809-844 and 227-285, `gt_trading_maintenance.xml` lines 24-60, `gt_fleet_coordination.xml` lines 191-223
- **Fixed**: Cache write operations were failing due to invalid property access and null keys (prerequisite fix)
  - **Root Cause 1**: Cannot access object properties inside `{}` syntax when using as table keys: `global.$GT_TradeCache.{$sellOffer.ware}.{$sellOffer.owner}` caused MD errors
  - **Root Cause 2**: Some trade offers had null owners (invalid/expired offers), causing "Failed to set null.{component...}" MD errors
  - **Solution**: Extract object references to variables before using as table keys, validate all keys are non-null before attempting cache write
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Trade caching system had reversed BuyOffer/SellOffer assignments (ich koffer!)
  - **Root Cause**: When caching trades, BuyOffer was assigned `$sellOffer` and SellOffer was assigned `$buyOffer` (backwards!)
  - **Impact**: Cached trades were unusable, causing 100% cache misses and forcing all ships to use expensive live searches
  - **Performance Impact**: Level 12+ ships performed full market scans every time instead of using cached routes
  - **Solution**: Corrected assignments to `$BuyOffer = $buyOffer` and `$SellOffer = $sellOffer`
  - Fixed in lines 672-690 in `gt_trading_search.xml`
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Trade cache retrieval system (was previously just a placeholder). Got lost during refactoring
  - Cache retrieval logic now fully functional - ships can actually USE cached trades
  - Validates cached offers still exist and are profitable before using them
  - Respects 10-minute cache expiration to prevent stale data
  - Checks distance and profit constraints against cached entries
  - Comprehensive debug logging for cache hits/misses
  - Implemented in lines 218-324 in `gt_trading_search.xml`
- **Fixed**: Invalid trade offer property access causing errors during logging
  - Trade offers can become invalid between order creation and logging due to:
    - Trade completion/consumption
    - Offer expiration
    - Station destruction/unavailability
  - Added validation checks for both buy and sell offers before accessing properties
  - Gracefully handles invalid offers with "[INVALID/EXPIRED]" messages
  - Fixed in both `gt_trade_logging.xml` (line 40) and `gt_trading_execution.xml` (line 149)

#### Market Intelligence
- **Fixed**: Invalid sector error during ship jumps/transitions
  - Mobile Satellite Intelligence now validates sector exists before scanning
  - Ships in jump transitions are safely skipped with debug logging
  - Line 90 in `gt_market_intelligence.xml`

#### Settings Menu
- **Fixed**: Settings menu not appearing in Extensions Options after loading saved games
  - **Root Cause**: `global.$GT_MenuRegistered` flag persists in save games but `Simple_Menu_API` clears all registrations on reload
  - When loading a save, the flag was `true` (from save) but menu was not registered (cleared by API), so registration was skipped
  - **Impact**: Menu only appeared on first load after new game, disappeared after save/reload
  - **Solution**: Removed the registration guard entirely - `Simple_Menu_API` handles duplicate registrations gracefully
  - Settings menu now accessible via ESC ‚Üí Extensions Options ‚Üí GalaxyTrader MK3
  - Fixed in lines 299-313 in `gt_global_settings.xml`
- **Fixed**: Settings menu failing to open with validation errors and registration issues
  - **Root Cause 1**: Menu registration was listening to BOTH `event_game_loaded` AND `md.Simple_Menu_API.Reloaded`, and was nested inside `Init` cue causing "Cannot change parent cue" errors with existing saves
  - **Root Cause 2**: All menu-related cues (SettingsMenu, handlers) also failed with "Cannot change parent cue" because saved games cached them as children of `Init`
  - **Root Cause 3**: Slider values could be outside valid ranges (e.g., saved value > max), causing "Start value is bigger than max select value" errors
  - **Impact**: Menu entry appeared but was empty on open; "Property lookup failed: SettingsMenu" because cue failed to load
  - **Solution**: 
    - **CRITICAL**: Followed Simple_Menu_API documentation pattern exactly:
      - Moved menu registration OUT of `Init` cue to root level
      - Renamed to `GT_MenuRegistration` (from RegisterOptionsMenu) to avoid save game conflicts
      - Changed to `instantiate="true"` (as per API docs)
      - Listen ONLY to `md.Simple_Menu_API.Reloaded` (removed `event_game_loaded`)
    - **Renamed ALL menu cues** to avoid "Cannot change parent cue" with existing saves:
      - `SettingsMenu` ‚Üí `GT_SettingsMenu`
      - `Setting_Toggle` ‚Üí `GT_Setting_Toggle`
      - `Position_Toggle` ‚Üí `GT_Position_Toggle`
      - `Slider_Update` ‚Üí `GT_Slider_Update`
      - `Relation_Update` ‚Üí `GT_Relation_Update`
    - Updated all references to renamed cues (onClick, onSliderCellChanged, etc.)
    - Added validation for ALL slider values (6 total) to clamp them to valid ranges before creating sliders
  - Fixed in lines 294-318, 352-656, 804, 835, 864, 908 in `gt_global_settings.xml`

### üìä Fleet Report Optimization

- **Optimized**: Fleet report for large fleets (100+ ships)
  - **Problem**: Reports with 100 ships generated 600-800 lines causing X4 widget overflow (2288px required vs 1882px available)
  - **Solution**: Limited individual ship details to top 15 performers by profit
  - Ships are automatically sorted by profitability
  - Fleet totals still calculated for all ships
  - Added "... and X more ships not shown" footer for transparency
  - Lines 83-176 in `gt_reporting.xml`

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Improved**: Error handling for timing-sensitive operations
  - All trade offer access now includes existence validation
  - Sector validation added before spatial queries
  - Property lookups use safe `?` operator consistently
  
- **Enhanced**: Debug logging for troubleshooting
  - Added context messages for skipped operations (invalid sectors, invalid offers)
  - Legacy ship name fix shows detailed progress and results
  - Better visibility into error recovery paths
  - **Added ROI percentage to trade selection debug logs** for easier cache verification
    - "BEST TRADE SELECTED" messages now show ROI% alongside profit
    - Makes it easy to see which trades meet the 20% cache threshold
    - Line 122 in `gt_trading_search.xml`
  - **Fixed XML parsing errors in cache debug logging**
    - X4 doesn't allow combining `@` (safe access) with `?` (null check) in same expression
    - Changed to nested `do_if` statements for proper null-safe access
    - Fixed in lines 316-325 and 792-796 in `gt_trading_search.xml`
