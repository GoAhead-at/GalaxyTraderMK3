### **XP Calculation System**

GalaxyTrader MK3 uses an advanced XP calculation system that rewards pilots based on trade quality, value, and difficulty:

#### **XP Formula**
```
Base XP = 50 (configurable)

Value Multiplier = Trade Value √∑ 10,000
Quality Bonus = 1.0 + (X4 Trade Quality √ó 0.5)
Distance Bonus = 1.0 + (min(Jumps, 10) √∑ 20)

Final XP = Base XP √ó Value Multiplier √ó Quality Bonus √ó Distance Bonus
Range: 10 - 1,000 XP per trade (clamped)
```

#### **XP Factors Explained**

1. **Trade Value** üí∞
   - Higher value trades = more XP
   - A 100,000 Cr trade gives 10√ó multiplier
   - Encourages profitable trading over low-value runs

2. **Trade Quality** ‚≠ê
   - Uses X4's native trade quality metric (-0.5 to +0.5)
   - Good trades (buying low, selling high) earn up to +25% bonus XP
   - Poor trades (buying high, selling low) earn less XP
   - Rewards smart trading decisions

3. **Distance Bonus** üöÄ
   - Longer routes earn more XP (up to 10 jumps counted)
   - Each jump adds 5% more XP
   - A 10-jump trade earns +50% bonus XP
   - Encourages long-distance trading as pilots level up

4. **Risk Bonus** ‚ö†Ô∏è (Future)
   - Trading in dangerous sectors will earn extra XP
   - Currently under development

#### **Example XP Calculations**

| Trade Type | Value | Quality | Distance | Final XP |
|------------|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Small Local Trade** | 10,000 Cr | 0.0 (average) | 1 jump | ~52 XP |
| **Medium Regional Trade** | 50,000 Cr | +0.2 (good) | 3 jumps | ~315 XP |
| **Large Long-Distance** | 200,000 Cr | +0.4 (excellent) | 10 jumps | **1,000 XP** (capped) |

#### **Progression Speed**
- **Level 1 ‚Üí 3**: ~5-10 small trades (new pilots, local trading)
- **Level 3 ‚Üí 6**: ~15-25 medium trades (multi-sector trading)
- **Level 6 ‚Üí 9**: ~25-40 larger trades (regional specialist)
- **Level 9 ‚Üí 12**: ~35-50 long-distance trades (cross-galaxy expert)
- **Level 12 ‚Üí 15**: ~45-60 elite trades (master trader)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Ship Not Gaining XP
- Check if XP system is enabled in configuration
- Verify ship is completing trades (selling goods, not just buying)
- Ensure ship isn't blocked at training threshold

### Training Not Starting
- Training is automatic when enabled
- Ship will show "[TRAINING]" prefix when training begins
- Check debug log for training station detection messages

### Ships Stuck with Question Marks
- The anti-stuck protection should prevent this
- Check debug log for validation failure messages
- Ensure stations are operational and accessible

2. **Training Stations**: Ships will automatically find training stations at levels 3, 6, 9, and 12
3. **Fleet Management**: Use multiple ships for better sector coverage and higher profits
